# Domain Modelling

Group 16
// names

## Domain and Scope

// 100-200 words

// Description of the domain and scope of the ontology, as determined by the application 

Our domain is voting data of official voting assemblies of different countries. 
We map votes, voters and voting assembly compositions through time. 

## Ontology Construction Methodology

// 100-200 words

// Description of the methodology that is used in the construction of the ontology 

We construct an ontology which is able to express the information we're interested in. 
We had an initial data source inspection to see what data is available. 
Our ontology is not more expressive than what is needed - unused terms would be redundant. 
See the Conceptualization section for details on the resulting ontology. 

For the practical task of constructing the ontology, we used Protege. 

## Conceptualization

// 200-300 words

// Conceptualization of the domain (concepts, relations) described, discussed and depicted in a drawing. 
// The conceptualization should encompass more than 15 classes and at least 5 properties 

### Classes

### Relations

### External Vocabularies and Ontologies

## Inferencing

// 100-500 words

// Describe the inferences

## Appendix

### Ontology

// Provide the ontology as a separate Turtle file.

### Evidence of Inference

// The ontology should produce meaningful inferences that are essential for the application. This should be evidenced by a screenshot of e.g. Protege reasoning results. (NB: For the final report: inferences should be on the external data)

### Revised version of Milestone 1

// Combine this with a revised version of milestone 1
