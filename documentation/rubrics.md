# General Guidelines

 - The next section lists the requirements per milestone. The words printed in bold are things we are looking for when grading the final report. Make sure you include them!
 - Word counts are just an indication. In general, when you stay under the limit, you havenâ€™t said everything. If you go over the limit, you may well be overly verbose (but there could be a good reason).
 - The milestones consist primarily of texts that you can readily reuse within the final report. If you faithfully submit each milestone, you should have enough material to staple them together in a final report.
 - The requirements set out per milestone correspond to the rubric categories that we will grade the final report by.
 - It may well be that you will not be able to provide everything in time for the Milestone. Be sure to submit at least something, or you will fail the final project.
 - You will not receive a separate grade for each milestone, but they are mandatory. Failing to submit for a milestone means that you will fail the final project.
 - The final report should be 8-12 pages in length (~4000-6000 words)
 - Note that it is generally harder to write shorter reports but still explain everything.

# Grading

# Rubrics

*italic: previously delivered milestone* , **bold:** next milestone 

 1. Report organization, layout and language
 2. *Description of the application and users*
 3. *Design and walkthrough*
 4. **Domain and conceptualization**
 5. **Ontology and inferencing**
 6. Data reuse
 7. Queries
 8. Application functionality

## Grading Scale for Ontology and Inferencing

|Tag|Effect on points|Description|
|---|---|---|
|None|-10|No evidence of any ontology or inferencing
|Novice|5|There is ontology, but no inferences
|Competent|11|Limited inferencing or not applied to external data|
|Proficient|20|Expressive ontology, clear use in application, applied to external data|
