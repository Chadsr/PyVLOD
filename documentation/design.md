## Goals
Many governments have began to provide endpoints for their internal data as a way to become more transparent and push for greater public participation.

The goal of our application is to give users both an intuitive insight into the (mostly machine-readable) governmental data through in-depth visualization, and provide them with the possibility to browse data in a way that's more user-friendly than that provided by the original data provider.
Furthermore, one of our biggest goals (and improvements over what is already available) is to infer new information that is not made explicit in the original database(s), by mapping information from various other sources such as:
* Politician background information
* Linking related bills?
* ...

## Users
The application is intended for people who wish to understand more about political systems and how they operate, as well as people with a background in political science in general (domain interest).. It may also be used by those who are interested technical topics such as graph theory, semantic web or big data (technical interest).

For the first group, we satisfy their needs by presenting them data they're interested in, in an organized, in-depth and visually appealing way. For the second group, we satisfy their needs with elaborations on how the application works. (the latter is also useful to help us produce required documentation)

## Design
The application will be best enjoyed on a large screen, as large network graphs will be visualized where necessary. So, we aim at desktop users. We may still stick to the mobile-first principle.
