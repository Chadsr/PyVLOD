# TODO's

This document is intended to help guide our efforts.
If you don't know what to do, you can pick a task from here.
If there's something that should be done but isn't written here, please write it.

## Urgent (next deadline)

 - [x] Infer something relevant and include screenshot
 - [x] Revise previous submission
 - [ ] write and deliver domain-modelling.md
     - [ ] Achieve deliverability: have 4 sections meeting specified minimum requirements
         - [x] Domain and Scope
         - [ ] Ontology Construction Methodology
         - [x] Conceptualization 
         - [ ] Ontology and Inferencing
     - [ ] Revise aggressively until midnight, guided by the rubrics (important: have rubrics in mind)
 
 
## Less urgent (not required for next deadline)

### Fixing/Improving Ontology

- [ ] Rename reactsToVote to reactsToBill
- [ ] Refactor demographics classes to subclasses of Person (make our own person class and map to DBO:Person?)
- [ ] Fix memberOf <Party> so that it's not longer an annotation but an object referring to a subclass of Party
- [Â ] Get gender from govtrack
- [ ] Map another dataset (EU, UK, ?)
- [ ] Make more inferences


### Redesign Importer

 - [ ] Redesign importer
 
The current data getter makes an avoidable large amount of queries for a task that is intended to be rarely performed. 
It is currently useful as an api, if we just want a small subset of govtrack's data. 
But we want all the data, and users will be accessing data often. 

So, we should consider downloading the data in bulk and hosting it ourselves. 
This would also be polite to the source data provider. 

### Another Data Importer

 - [ ] Make another Data Importer

We should have at least two data getters. Two is enough to force us to handle data from a set of datasets (rather than one) and to have a modular data-getter code base and to show we can align diversely formatted data.

### Data View Configuration in LD-R

 - [ ] Figure where/how to configure Data Views
 - [ ] Configure some Data Views

We want to configure the views of our data.
For instance, we want to output that voters are a v:Voter,
but not that they are a owl:Thing. Where/how to configure this?

### Computing Statistics

 - [ ] Figure where/how to compute statistics
We want to compute, cache and display statistics (such as proportion of democrats who votes yes on this bill). Where/how?

### Advanced Analysis
 - [ ]
