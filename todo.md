# TODO's

This document is intended to help guide our efforts.
If you don't know what to do, you can pick a task from here.
If there's something that should be done but isn't written here, please write it.
 
## Less urgent (not required for next deadline)

### Fixing/Improving Ontology

- [ ] Rename reactsToVote to reactsToBill
- [ ] Refactor demographics classes to subclasses of Person (make our own person class and map to DBO:Person?)
- [ ] Fix memberOf <Party> so that it's not longer an annotation but an object referring to a subclass of Party
- [Â ] Get gender from govtrack
- [ ] Map another dataset (EU, UK, ?)
- [ ] Make more inferences

### Redesign Importer

 - [ ] Redesign importer

#### Acquiring Bulk Data

- [x] acquire bulk data

The first version of the importer made intolerably many http queries (see complexity annotation within code) for tiny slices of data. 
It was rewritten to dig through data from govtrack's bulk data, which is structured differently than the data at the http endpoint.  
Refinement remains for the rewritten querier.

- [x] set up framework enabling extraction of all interesting triples
- [ ] configure to perform exctraction of all interesting triples

### Another Data Importer

 - [ ] Make another Data Importer

We should have at least two data getters. Two is enough to force us to handle data from a set of datasets (rather than one) and to have a modular data-getter code base and to show we can align diversely formatted data.

### Data View Configuration in LD-R

 - [ ] Figure where/how to configure Data Views
     - [ ] Play around with options in reactor.js
 - [ ] Configure some Data Views

We want to configure the views of our data.
For instance, we want to output that voters are a v:Voter,
but not that they are a owl:Thing. Where/how to configure this?

### Computing Statistics

 - [ ] Figure where/how to compute statistics
We want to compute, cache and display statistics (such as proportion of democrats who votes yes on this bill). Where/how?

### Advanced Analysis
 - [ ] 
 
 
## Past

### Milestone 2

 - [x] Infer something relevant and include screenshot
 - [x] Revise previous submission
 - [x] write and deliver domain-modelling.md
     - [x] Achieve deliverability: have 4 sections meeting specified minimum requirements
         - [x] Domain and Scope
         - [x] Ontology Construction Methodology
         - [x] Conceptualization 
         - [x] Ontology and Inferencing
     - [x] Revise aggressively until midnight, guided by the rubrics (important: have rubrics in mind)
